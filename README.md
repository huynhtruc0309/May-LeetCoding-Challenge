# Problem Set
In this challenge, there are a total of 31 problems with increasing difficulty each day. I have developed clean and optimal solutions possible. For each problem, I provide solutions from the simplest one to a more complex one along with its complexity. 

For solving each problem, I suggest following these steps:
* Propose different test cases.
* Method to solve the problem
* Optimization or a better method to solve the problem.
* Complexity analysis
* Expected or actual output
* Worst, average, and best-case scenario

And finally having fun!!!
